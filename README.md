# Project InterMed (Landing Page)

Design of a landing page of a fictional clinic named InterMed, made with the aim of practicing HTML concepts studied during the HTML5 Web Developer course by DigitalInnovationOne.

The updated version of this project is quite different and more advanced than the one proposed by the course. It is a static page, made only with HTML and CSS.
