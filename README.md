# Project InterMed (Landing Page)

Design of a landing page for a medical clinic named InterMed, produced with the aim of practicing the HTML concepts studied during the HTML5 Web Developer course by DigitalInnovationOne.

The project has three pages, which are the home page, the services page and the contact page.


This is an improved and more advanced version compared to the initially proposed project, and it is also responsive. It is a static page, made only with HTML and CSS. A few lines of JavaScript were used just to enable the display of the menu on mobile devices.



During the decoding of this project, some concepts from the SMACSS (architecture) and BEM (nomenclature) standards were applied for the organization of style sheets.
